## Dataset

I plan to open-source the full dataset used in my experiments.  
Because of its large size, I havenâ€™t yet finalized a public hosting location. I will announce a solution by **June 2025**.  

> **Need it sooner?**  
> You can meet me at S&P 2025 in Los Alamitos, CA, and Iâ€™ll bring a hard drive during my poster/demo sessionâ€”but please **contact me in advance** so I can prepare.

## Checkpoints & Baselines

Pretrained model checkpoints are available upon request.  
If youâ€™d like to use PEFTGuard as a baseline but donâ€™t plan to run the full training pipeline, feel free to **contact me**. Iâ€™m happy to shareâ€”but please note my current schedule is quite busy, so organization might be a bit rough.

## Issues & Support

I monitor GitHub Issues and will respond when time permits, but Iâ€™m juggling many deadlines at the moment, so **please forgive any delays** ðŸ˜….
